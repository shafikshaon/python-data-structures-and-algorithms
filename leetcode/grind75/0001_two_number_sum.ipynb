You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.\n",

    "\n",
    "This implementation uses nested loops to compare each number with every other number. The outer loop iterates over the elements of the input array `nums` starting from index 0, and the inner loop starts from the index `i + 1` to avoid duplicate results.\n",

    "For each iteration, the current number from the outer loop and the target value are used to calculate the desired value of the other number, and if the desired value is found in the input array, the indices of the two numbers are returned as the solution."
