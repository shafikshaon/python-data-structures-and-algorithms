Output:
Words counter: Counter({'i': 2, 'love': 2, 'leetcode': 1, 'coding': 1}).

Add word: i, freq: 2 to heap.
Heap now: [(i, 2)].

Add word: love, freq: 2 to heap.
Heap now: [(love, 2), (i, 2)].

Add word: leetcode, freq: 1 to heap.
Heap now: [(leetcode, 1), (i, 2), (love, 2)].
Removing (leetcode, 1) from heap.

Add word: coding, freq: 1 to heap.
Heap now: [(coding, 1), (i, 2), (love, 2)].
Removing (coding, 1) from heap.
Output: ['i', 'love'].

Time Complexity: O(nlogk), where N is the length of words. We count the frequency of each word in O(N) time, 
then we add N words to the heap, each in O(logk) time. 
Finally, we pop from the heap up to kkk times or just sort all elements in the heap as the returned result, 
which takes O(klogk). As kâ‰¤N  O(N)+O(Nlogk)=O(Nlogk)

Space Complexity: O(n)
